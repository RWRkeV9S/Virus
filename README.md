# Virus
It's just a "virus" I wrote a few days ago for fun(and homework). It encrypts files in the current folder using XOR encryption, and running the program again will decrypt them.
My packing technique isn't great, and I'm not sure if it will run on your computer. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, feel free to contact me at 1375448726@qq.com.
